# Anagrams
Anagram produces a new word by rearranging the letters of a given word, using all the original letters exactly once.

Notes:

1. I found that anagram is the most optimized when using hash table as a data structure compared to other data structures such as binary search tree, heap, and etc. 
2. I implemented a good hash function and algorithm, making hash table perform more efficiently.
